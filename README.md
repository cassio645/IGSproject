Usando API em Django

The IGS team is growing every month and now we need to have some applications to
manage employee information, such as name, e-mail and department. As any application
written at IGS, It must have an API to allow integrations.

"IGS-Software Manager" app must have:
    - ✅ A django admin panel to manage employees data.
    - ✅A Django API to list, add and remove employees in '/employee' 
    - ✅the code should be delivered to a github.com repository.
